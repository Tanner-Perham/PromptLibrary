# Anti-Convergence Prompting Framework

## Purpose
Break free from generic AI responses by forcing exploration of diverse perspectives, challenging assumptions, and generating insights your competitors won't see. This framework prevents AI from "converging" on safe, conventional wisdom.

## The Problem
When everyone uses AI the same way, everyone gets similar results. If your competitors are also using ChatGPT for strategy, you're all getting variations of the same mediocre output. Anti-convergence techniques generate genuinely original insights.

## The Core Framework

Copy and adapt this framework for your strategic questions:

```
I need to analyze the following question using anti-convergence techniques to avoid
generic responses and surface non-obvious insights:

[YOUR STRATEGIC QUESTION HERE]

Please follow this process:

1. GENERATE THREE CONFLICTING APPROACHES
   For each approach:
   - Give it a distinct name
   - Describe the core strategy or recommendation
   - State the KEY ASSUMPTION it relies on
   - Explain what would have to be TRUE for this to succeed
   - Identify what a CRITIC would argue against it

   Make sure these three approaches genuinely conflict—not just variations on one theme.

2. EXAMINE HIDDEN ASSUMPTIONS
   For the question itself:
   - What assumptions am I making by framing the question this way?
   - What am I taking for granted that might be wrong?
   - How might this question look different from another stakeholder's perspective?
   - What would a contrarian say I'm missing entirely?

3. SEARCH BIAS ANALYSIS
   Before doing any research:
   - Predict how a straightforward search might bias results
   - Identify what perspectives or evidence might be systematically excluded
   - Design 3-4 specific searches that work to overcome those biases
   - Include at least one search for contradictory evidence

4. DEVIL'S ADVOCATE ROUND
   Take the approach that seems most popular or conventional.
   - Find evidence that specifically contradicts it
   - Identify successful companies/people who did the OPPOSITE
   - Look for situations where this conventional wisdom failed
   - Consider what changed conditions might make conventional wisdom obsolete

5. NON-OBVIOUS INSIGHTS
   Based on everything above:
   - What's one insight that wouldn't emerge from standard analysis?
   - What's something your competitors probably aren't considering?
   - What assumption, if wrong, would completely change your approach?
   - What's the highest-leverage question you should be asking instead?

IMPORTANT: Avoid generic business frameworks. I need specific, actionable insights
that apply to my actual situation.

## Quick Variations for Specific Needs

### For Strategic Decisions
```
I need three CONFLICTING strategic options for: [DECISION]

For each option:
1. Core approach
2. Key assumption that must be true
3. What would prove this assumption wrong
4. Which stakeholders would hate this option and why

Then find evidence that contradicts the most obvious/popular option.
```

### For Market Positioning
```
Our competitors are likely thinking: [CONVENTIONAL WISDOM]

Challenge this:
1. What are three ways we could position ourselves that CONTRADICT this conventional approach?
2. For each contrarian position, what would have to be true about the market?
3. Find examples of companies that succeeded by going against this conventional wisdom
4. What emerging trends might make conventional wisdom obsolete?
```

### For Problem-Solving
```
The conventional approach to [PROBLEM] is: [STANDARD SOLUTION]

Apply anti-convergence:
1. What assumptions does this standard solution make?
2. Generate three approaches that DON'T rely on those assumptions
3. Find industries or contexts where they solve similar problems completely differently
4. What would someone from a totally different field suggest?
```

### For Innovation
```
In our industry, everyone assumes: [COMMON BELIEF]

Challenge this systematically:
1. What if this assumption is wrong or becoming wrong?
2. Who is already operating as if it's wrong?
3. What technology or social changes might invalidate it?
4. If we built a company assuming the OPPOSITE, what would it look like?
```

## "Another Round" - Iterative Deepening

After getting initial results, push further:

```
Do another round, specifically finding:
1. One source that conflicts with the majority view you presented
2. One source that supports an entirely different angle
3. One example of where this conventional wisdom failed
4. Evidence that my current framing of the question might be wrong

Update your analysis based on what you find.
```

## Example Usage

**Scenario**: SaaS company considering expansion strategy

**Standard Prompt** (produces generic results):
```
What are the best growth strategies for a B2B SaaS company?
```

**Anti-Convergence Prompt**:
```
I need anti-convergence analysis for this question:
"Should we expand through more enterprise clients, or double down on SMB market?"

Generate three conflicting approaches:
1. Enterprise-focused
2. SMB-focused
3. Something that challenges the premise of this binary choice

For each, identify:
- Key assumption
- What would have to be true
- What a critic would argue

Then search for evidence that contradicts whatever approach is most conventional
in our industry (typically enterprise focus). Find examples of SaaS companies that
succeeded by deliberately doing the opposite.

Finally: What's the assumption behind even framing this as a choice between
enterprise and SMB? What am I missing by thinking about it this way?
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Don't do this**: "What are some different perspectives on X?"
- Too vague, AI will give generic diverse viewpoints

**Do this**: "Generate three approaches to X that genuinely conflict with each other. For each, state what assumption must be true and what would prove it wrong."

**Don't do this**: "Think outside the box about Y"
- Meaningless prompt that gets generic "creative" responses

**Do this**: "The conventional approach to Y is Z. Find examples of companies that deliberately did the opposite and succeeded. What were they assuming that others weren't?"

---

## When This Is Most Valuable

1. **High-stakes strategic decisions** where conventional wisdom might be wrong
2. **Competitive positioning** when you need differentiation
3. **Innovation initiatives** where you need non-obvious approaches

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Explicit About Conflict**: Demand that approaches genuinely contradict each other
2. **Name the Assumptions**: Force AI to state what must be true for each approach
3. **Search for Contradictions**: Specifically look for evidence against the conventional wisdom
4. **Iterate**: Do multiple rounds, each time pushing for more contrarian thinking
5. **Reality Check**: Not all contrarian ideas are good—use judgment to evaluate feasibility
